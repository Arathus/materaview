# Setup
## 1. Provide the gradle dependency

```gradle
implementation "com.arathus:materaview:v0.1"
```


## 2. Add the MateraView to your XML
```xml
new DrawerBuilder().withActivity(this).build();
```

Great. Your drawer is now ready to use.

# Sample

## Properties:

* `app:ci_width`
* `app:ci_height`
* `app:ci_margin`
* `app:ci_drawable`
* `app:ci_drawable_unselected`
* `app:ci_animator`
* `app:ci_animator_reverse`
* `app:ci_orientation` (default:horizontal)
* `app:ci_gravity` (default:center)

# FAQ

#### Does I get the same view every time I use it ?
Quite the opposite. Everytime the view is created you get a new MateraView with random generated layer elements according to your predefined settings and to the material design guideline

#### Does it make the app slow ?
The cordinates of the elements, and the colors are created and saved in the constructor of the View; after it is done the library just draw the preset values. The MateraView was built from basic elements, therefore the library only use 1-3% of the processor

#### Can I save the generated designs ?
At this point of the development you are unable to do it, but it's possible that in the further versions this will be an option
